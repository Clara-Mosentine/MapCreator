For this project, I used Google Firebase as a the API and database.
I also attempted to use firebase for user authentication, but had difficulties connecting the firebase instance to the website inputs.
I'll hopefully be able to upload or share a video of the sites current functionality, but that will likely happen later.
Thanks, and keep on keeping on!
